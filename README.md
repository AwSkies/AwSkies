### *A.K.A. AwSky / AwSkies*
Hi! I'm a physics and computer science student from the Boston area, and I'm currently studying at McGill University in MontrÃ©al. I love using programming to make interesting tools and projects related to whatever I'm into at the moment, and I'm willing to learn anything and everything I need to turn my ideas into a reality. I program all kinds of things, but most consistently physics projects and game development.  
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on *the McGill Rocket Team, and a website to play PokÃ©mon battle puzzles on Showdown!*
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning *React and TypeScript*
- âš¡ Fun fact: *I know how to program Texas Instruments calculators*
